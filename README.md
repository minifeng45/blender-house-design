# Blender-house-design
Build house by Blender Python API, assisted by ChatGpt

## Description

The cheapest way to conduct a design is doing by oneself. I create a respository that share my learning experience and products.

## ChatGpt 

Be awared of that ChatpGPT was trained until September 2021. [Blender 2.93 LTS](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-93/) is the best version to interact with ChatGpt.
